# Hangman Game

A classic implementation of the Hangman word guessing game built in [programming language].

## Description

Hangman is a word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" is drawn. The game ends when either the player successfully guesses the word or the hangman drawing is completed.

## Features

- Random word selection from a built-in dictionary
- Visual ASCII art representation of the hangman
- Interactive command-line interface
- Track of remaining guesses
- Display of previously guessed letters

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
2. The game will display a hidden word with underscores representing each letter
3. Guess one letter at a time
4. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly
5. The game ends when you either:
   - Successfully guess the word
   - Run out of attempts

## Game Rules

- Only single letters are accepted as valid guesses
- Both uppercase and lowercase letters are accepted
- You cannot guess the same letter twice
- Each incorrect guess adds another part to the hangman
